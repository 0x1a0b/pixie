# Pixie Colab Notebooks


## What is Colab?

Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, is an executable document that lets you write, run and share code within google drive. 

These notebooks are like a [jupyter nodebooks](https://jupyter.org/) stored in google drive. Originally designed for use by the AI/ML community these are great to work with Pixie in a lightweight and interactive manner.
